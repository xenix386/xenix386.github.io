    <p> 
   I am currently a student at the Plano Academy High School and plan to get a job related to software development but I do have a particular interest in a cyber security related job. In my spare time I also have a minor Ham radio hobby and I am one of the founding  members of the ham radio club at my school.

    <h1>The Academy</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The Plano Academy High School is a magnet school aimed at kids interested in the various STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) subjects. I personally had interests in all of the STEAM subjects, especially science and technology and figured it would be a great place to specialise in my interests. Another aspect of the Academy is its emphasis on Project based learning. While I wasn't a huge fan of every project I feel it gives a pretty good idea of what its like to work in groups in the real world and the projects gave a chance to apply some of the knowledge that we learned in our various classes to relevant material. Another thing the Academy is pretty good at is corporate exposure. Often times there will be people from various companies touring the campus and checking out what were doing during school hours. In most projects we also utilise the parts of the agile model to manage and execute various tasks (scrums and all the sprint related stuff). Overall I'd say that my time at the academy gave some insight into working with groups in the real world and working with each members strengths and weaknesses to get the job done.

    <h2>Stop the presses</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      In stop the presses we were tasked with the creation of an "anniversary" edition news paper relating to a historic court case. The case out guild got was Hernandez Vs. Texas, which was a very interesting court case dealing with jury discrimination. Funny thing is Hernandez was believed to be wrongfully brought up on murder charges and even though he won the law suit (Hernandez V. Texas) he lost the criminal retrial (Texas V. Hernandez) sucks to be him. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway in terms of stuff we did for stop the presses our team was tasked with creating articles for and designing the business section of our paper "The Cattle Log", sadly I had zero input in choosing the name.
      We used the adobe sweet to design our paper layout, mostly in-design for this project.

    <h2>K'ching</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Ah K'ching, such a great project. For this project we were supposed to create our own "company" that sold a "product", and for this project I was apart of Cook's Cooling Solutions, where we manufactured affordable swamp coolers for consumers in arid regions. There was a lot of extra stuff in this project, it tied into economics really well running a business and taking out loans at all. Below you'll find our business plan and some pictures of our booth.

    <h2>Turning Points</h2>
    <hr>   
    <p>
      Turing Points was an, interesting project to come after K'ching. It was a bit more laid back than K'ching in my opinion, but then again for this project, we were tasked with writing an essay about a topic of our choice that was a "turning point". So for my paper I decided to write about UNIX, luckily it wasn't too hard I already knew a lot about UNIX but I did learn some pretty interesting stuff from my research about the origins of UNIX. Latter on in the project after we finished the research essay (little did I know I would be working on it for about 2 months because of UNT but it was worth it in the end) we created an exhibit with a team of "like minded individuals". Below are the images of our team's exhibit, I like the final product it was actually a big hit with some of the parents, since for our exhibit we were displaying old versions of Windows and DOS since no one has herd of UNIX. Another thing we made individually was an animation using Adobe Flashâ„¢, mine can also be found below but good luck playing it on modern versions of flash.

    <h2>Going Viral</h2>

    <p>
      The final project of the year, for this project my group decided on geomagnetic storms as our subject.
      Geomagnetic storms have been an interesting topic of research, so little is relatively known about 
      and yet they are capable of bringing society as we know it to its knees. In terms of content we have 
      some videos of our tests with various methods to negate EMPs by building our own EMP and testing it 
      on various items and materials. Don't worry about us leveling a block or something our EMP can barely
      turn off a calculator but its good enough for demonstrative purposes.
