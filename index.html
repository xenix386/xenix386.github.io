    <p> 
   I am currently a student at the Plano Academy High School and plan to get a job related to software development but I do have a particular interest in a cyber security related job. In my spare time I also have a minor Ham radio hobby and I am one of the founding  members of the ham radio club at my school.

      The Plano Academy High School is a magnet school aimed at kids interested in the various STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) subjects. I personally had interests in all of the STEAM subjects, especially science and technology and figured it would be a great place to specialise in my interests. Another aspect of the Academy is its emphasis on Project based learning. While I wasn't a huge fan of every project I feel it gives a pretty good idea of what its like to work in groups in the real world and the projects gave a chance to apply some of the knowledge that we learned in our various classes to relevant material. Another thing the Academy is pretty good at is corporate exposure. Often times there will be people from various companies touring the campus and checking out what were doing during school hours. In most projects we also utilise the parts of the agile model to manage and execute various tasks (scrums and all the sprint related stuff). Overall I'd say that my time at the academy gave some insight into working with groups in the real world and working with each members strengths and weaknesses to get the job done.
